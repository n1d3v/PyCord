# PyCord
The Discord Webpage wrapped using PyQtWebEngine.
# What is the difference between the official client?
Nothing, it's just the Discord Website so your client will look and feel normal.

(Also that it can work on BSD distros)
# Why?
I switched to FreeBSD and needed a Discord client.

Just made one in Python and works fine.
# Supported Devices
Anything that can run python3 and PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine.
